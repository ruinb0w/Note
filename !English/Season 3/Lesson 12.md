# Lesson 12 

## Life on a desert island

​	Most of us have `formed an unrealistic picture of` life on a desert island. 

> unrealistic：adj. 不现实的
>
> picture (v.) ≈ image
>
> form an unrealistic picture of sth.：对……抱有不切实际的幻想

We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of `paradise` where the sun always shines. 

> paradise: a place or situation that seems beautiful or perfect

Life there is simple and good. `Ripe` fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. 

> The time is ripe (for sth.)：it is a very suitable time for something to happen, especially when 
> it should have happened sooner.

The other side of the picture is quite the opposite. Life on a desert island is `wretched`. 

> wretched ≈ miserable

You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, Waiting for a boat which never comes. 

> either … or …：要么……要么……

Perhaps there is `an element of` truth in both these pictures, but few us have had the opportunity to find out.

> an element of：一点点；少许

　　Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were `hardly` any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not `prove to be` a problem. 

> hardly = very little or very few
>
> prove to be = turn out to be

The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. They caught `lobster` and fish every day，and, as one of them put it 'ate like kings'. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were `genuinely` sorry that they had to leave.

> lobster：n. 龙虾
>
> shrimp：n. 小虾
>
> genuinely sorry = really sorry
