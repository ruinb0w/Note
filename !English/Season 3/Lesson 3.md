​	Some time ago, and interesting discovery was made by `archaeologists` on the Aegean island of Kea. 

> archaeologists 考古学家

An American team `explored` a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. 

> explore: 考察, 探索; 探讨; 勘探

The city at one time `must have been` `prosperous`, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. 

> must have done 对过去实时的肯定猜测
>
> must be 对现在实时的肯定猜测
>
> prosperous 繁荣的

Houses -- often three storeys high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was `equipped with` a `drainage` system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

> equip : vt. 装备，配备

> * equip sb. / sth. with sth.
> * be equipped with  

　　The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of `worship` from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman `times`. 

> worship 朝拜

> times 时代

In the most `sacred` room of temple, clay `fragments` of fifteen statues were found. 

> sacred ≈ holy 神圣的
>
> fragments ≈ pieces

Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among `remains` `dating from` the fifteenth century B.C. 

> remains: n. [pl.]历史文物/遗迹
>
> date from: 追溯到；始于；起源于

It's missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess `turned out to be` a very modern-looking woman. 

> turn out to be → (surprise) 竟然是、原来是

She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. `Despite` her great age, she was very `graceful` indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.

> despite ≈ in spite of 尽管

> graceful 优美的
