## The loss of the Titanic

​	The great ship, Titanic, `sailed for New York from Southampton` on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1,316 passengers and `crew` of 891.

Even `by modern standards`, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. 

> by ... standard: 根据...标准
>
> 低于标准：fall short of standard / below standard 
>
> 达到标准：(live) up to the standard

At the time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her `first voyage` with heavy loss of life.

> first voyage 处女航

　　Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy water of the North Atlantic, huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just `in time`, `narrowly` missing the immense walk of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. 

> in time : 及时
>
> narrowly : adv. 刚刚，勉强地

Suddenly, there was a `slight` trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so `faint` that no one though that the ship had been damaged. 

> slight : something is very small in degree or quantity 轻微的；细微的（程度或量）
>
> faint : a sound, colour, mark, feeling, or quality has very little strength or intensity 轻微的；细微的（力量或密度）

Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.
