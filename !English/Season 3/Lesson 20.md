# Lesson 20 

## Pioneer pilots

​	In 1908 `Lord` Northcliffe `offered a prize of $1,000 to the first man` who would fly across the English Channel. Over a year passed `before` the first attempt was made. On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning, Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the 'Antoinette IV.' 

> Lord：a man who has a high rank in the nobility, for example, a marquis, an earl, or a viscount. 勋爵（公爵以下贵族的统称）
>
> offer sth. to sb. = offer sb. sth. 为某人提供
>
> before: until

He had travelled only seven miles across the Channel when his engine `failed` and he `was forced to land` on sea. The 'Antoinette' floated on the water until Latham was picked up by a ship.

> his engine failed: his engine broke down
>
> fail to do：not succeed in doing sth.
>
> be force to do sth.

　　Two days later, Louis Bleriot arrived near Calais with a plane called 'No. XI'. Bleriot had been making planes since 1905 and this was his lattes model. A week before, he had completed a successful overland flight during which he `covered` twenty-six miles. Latham, however, did not give up easily. He, too, arrived near Calais on the same day with a new 'Antoinette'. 

> cover：travel a particular distance

It looked `as if` there would be an exciting race across the Channel. Both planes were going to take off on July 25th, but Latham failed to get up early enough, After making a short test flight at 4,15 a.m., Bleriot set off half an hour later. His great flight lasted thirty-seven minutes.

When he landed near Dover, the first person to greet him was a local policeman. Latham made another attempt a week later and got `within half a mile of` Dover, but he was unlucky again. His engine failed and he landed on the sea for the second time.

> within ... (distance) of ... (place)：not more than …
