# Lesson 7

## Mutilated ladies

​	Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large `bank note` in your back pocket? 

> bank note: money

When you rescued your trousers, did note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't `despair` when they made mistakes like this (and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with `claims` from people who `fed` their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to `chew up` money!

　　A recent case `concerns` Jane Butlin whose `fiancé`, John, runs a successful furniture business. 

> concern v. 与……有关; 关心，担忧
>
> fiancé 未婚夫 bridegroom 新郎
>
> fiancée 未婚妻 bride 新娘

John had very good day and put his wallet containing \$3,000 into the microwave oven for `safekeeping`. Then he and Jane went `horse-riding`. 

> safekeeping : 安全保存
>
> horse-riding : 骑马

When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the `microwave oven` and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well. 

> microwave oven 微波炉

Imagine their `dismay` when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! 

> dismay: a strong feeling of fear, worry, or sadness that is caused by something unpleasant and unexpected

John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilate Ladies! They examined the remain and John got all his money back. '`So long as` there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,' said a spokeswoman for the Bank.

'Last year, we paid $1.5m on 21,000 claims. Damaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes, and 'lady' refers to this.
