# Lesson 36 

## A chance in a million

​	We are less `credulous` than we used to be. In the nineteenth century, a novelist would `bring his story to a conclusion` by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences -- most of them `wildly` `improbable`. 

> credulous adj. 轻信的
>
> incredulous adj. 表示怀疑的，不相信的
>
> bring ... to conclusion = bring ... to an end / conclude
>
> wildly = extremely / shockingly
>
> improbable adj. 不大可能的

Readers happily accepted the fact that an `obscure` maidservant was really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was `presumed` dead, was really alive all the time and `wickedly plotting` to `bring about` the hero's `downfall`. And so on. 

> obscure adj. 不起眼的 = unknown, 含糊的, 晦涩的
>
> presume v. 假定；推测
>
> wickedly adv. 心眼坏地，居心叵测地 = evilly
>
> plot n.情节 v.密谋 plan
>
> bring about = cause
>
> downfall 没落

Modern readers would find such naive solution totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes `conspire` to bring about coincidences which `anyone but` a nineteenth century novelist would find `incredible`.

> conspire v.（事件）凑在一起致使，共同导致
>
> anyone but 任何人除了…… / 只有
>
> incredible: too strange to believe

　　When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stooped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman `commented on` the workman's close `resemblance` to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz `poured scorn on the idea`, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. 

> comment on … 评论；就……发表看法
>
> resemblance n. 相似 — resemble vt. 与……相像
>
> pour scorn on sb. / sth. 讥笑……(BrE)

Though Mrs. Busssman fully `acquainted with` this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. 

> be acquainted with 已经知道

When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and `was separated from` his unit. The hospital had been bombed and Hans had `made his way` back into Western Germany on foot. 

> be separated from … 和……分离开，和……分散
>
> make one's way …  慢慢向……前进 to move towards someplace slowly

Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had `become of` the inhabitants. Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.

> become of 结果如何，发生了……情况
