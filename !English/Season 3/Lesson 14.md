# Lesson 14 

## A noble gangster

​	There was a tine when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago that to pay large sums of money to gangsters `in return for` 'protection.' If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters would quickly put a man `out of business` by destroying his shop. 

> in return for：作为……的报答
>
> out of business 歇业

Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime. `As long ago as` the fourteenth century, an Englishman, `Sir` John Hawkwood, made the `remarkable` discovery that people `would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.`

> as long ago as：追溯到
>
> Sir：the title used in front of the name of a knight or baronet
>
> would rather do than do 宁愿做……而非…… 
>
> remarkable: amazing, outstanding

　　Six hundred years ago, Sir Johan Hawkwood arrived in Italy with `a band of` soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon `made a name for himself` and `came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.` 

> a band of people：a group of people who have joined together because they share an interest or belief. 
>
> make a name for oneself: 成名，出名
>
> come to be known to sb. as ≈ gradually be known to sb. as

Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to `hire his soldiers to princes` who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a `city-state` and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away protection money was paid to them. 

> hire sb. to sb.：使……受雇于，把……雇给……
>
> city-state：n. 城邦

Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero. When he died at the age of eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a pictured with as `dedicated` to the memory of 'the most `valiant` soldier and most `notable` leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue.'

> dedicate 献给
>
> valiant：very brave
>
> notable：显著的，著名的
