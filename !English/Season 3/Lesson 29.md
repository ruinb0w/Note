# Lesson 29 

## Funny or not?

​	Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on were we have been brought up. The sense of `humour` `is mysteriously bound up with` national characteristics. A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke. In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke witch would make an Englishman laugh to tears.

> humour (BrE) humor (AmE)
>
> be bound up with = be closely connected to

　　Most funny stories `are based on` comic situations. In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a `universal` appeal. No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films. However, a new type of humour, which `stems largely from` the U.S., has recently `come into fashion`. It is called 'sick humour'. Comedians base their jokes on tragic situation like violent death or serious accidents. Many people find this sort of joke distasteful The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to judge for yourself.

> be based on 基于某基础之上(被动)
>
> base sth. on sth.(主动)
>
> universal adj. 宇宙范围内的，普遍的
>
> stem from = come from
>
> come into fashion = become popular

　　A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas. From the moment he arrived there, he kept on `pestering` his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home. He `dreaded` having to spend Christmas in hospital. Though the doctors did his best, the patient's recovery was slow. 

> pester v. 一再要求，纠缠
>
> * pester sb. for / with sth. 
> * pester sb. to do sth.
>
> dread + n. / to do / that … = be afraid of + n. / to do / that …

On Christmas Day, the man still had his right leg in plaster. He spent a miserable day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing. The following day, however, the doctor `consoled` him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good. The good. The man `took heart` and, sure enough, on New Years' Eve he was able to `hobble` along to a party. 

> console = comfort-consolation
>
> * console sb. with
> * console sb. on sth.
> * console oneself 
>
> take heart 与lose hear相反
>
> hobble 一瘸一拐地跛行

`To compensate for` his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him. In the process, he enjoyed himself thoroughly and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals. He was still `mumbling` something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.

> to compensate for = to make up for 
>
> mumble: speak quietly, not clearly, difficult to understand
