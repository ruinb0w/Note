# Lesson 41

## Illusions of Pastoral peace

​	The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. City born and city `bred`. I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasional visit during the weekend. Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always `go into raptures` at the mere mention of the country. 

> appeal: attract
>
> breed - bred - bred

> be in raptures / go into raptures: feel great pleasure and happiness

Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of hem has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living. Nothing can be `compared`, he `maintains`, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture.

> compare A with B: A和B比较

My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV -- `virtually` the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the `dubious` privilege of living in the country is `beyond me`. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.

> be dubious about / of ... - be doubtful of / about …

> beyond me – I can't understand

　　If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They `invariably` live nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning.

As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. The city `dweller` never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. 

> dweller : someone who lives in a particular type of place

Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never have to `make do with` second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and `stagger` home loaded with as many of the `exotic` items as they can carry. `Nor` is the city without its moments of beauty. 

> make do with / without = manage with / without
>
> stagger: unable to walk steadily because of drunkenness or burden
>
> exotic: foreign, unfamiliar but exciting

There is something comforting about the warm `glow shed` by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that `descends on` deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.
