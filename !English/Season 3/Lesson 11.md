# Lesson 11 

## Not guilty

​	`Customs` Officers `are quite tolerant` these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. 

> customs n. 海关
>
> Custom officer 海关官员
>
> customs duty 关税
>
> be tolerant of 对……宽容

Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional `smuggler`, `on the other hand`, `is never troubled by` such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. 

> hardened adj. 变硬的, 坚定的, 老练的 
>
> smuggler n. 走私者 
>
> on the one hand … on the other hand … 一方面...另一方面...
>
> be troubled by 被...所困扰

When I returned form abroad recently, a particularly `officious` young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.

> officious adj. 爱管闲事

　　'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, `looking me in the eye`.

> look sb. in the eye 直视某人

　　'No', I answered confidently.

　　'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?'

　　'Not at all,' I answered.

　　The Officer went through the case with great care. All the thing I had packed so carefully were soon in a `dreadful` mess. 

> dreadful = extremely terrible

I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face `light up`. He had `spotted` a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he `pounced on` it with delight.

> light up : suddenly look very surprised or happy
>
> spot: 
>
> pounce on: to criticize someone's mistakes or ideas very quickly and eagerly

　　'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'

　　'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.' Then I added with a smile, 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'

　　As I expected, he did not believe me.

　　'Try it!' I said encouragingly.

　　The officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.
