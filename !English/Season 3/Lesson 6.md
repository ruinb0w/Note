# Lesson 6

### Smash-and-grab

​	The expensive shops in a famous near Piccadilly were just "opening. 

At this time of the morning, the `arcade` was almost empty. 

> arcade n. 有拱廊的街道

Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was `admiring` a new display. 

> admiring: look at sb. / sth. with pleasure 欣赏

Two of his assistants `had been working` busily since eight o'clock and `had only just finished`. 

> had been doing 过去完成进行时
>
> had finisehd 过去完成时

Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully `arranged` on a background of black `velvet`. 

> arrange v. 布置; 安排
>
> velvet n: 天鹅绒, 丝绒

After `gazing` at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

> gaze v.凝视

　　The silence was suddenly `broken` when a large car, `with` its headlights on and its home `blaring`, roared down the arcade.

> break-broke-broken
>
> * take a break n. 休息
>
> * Give me a break! 得了吧！<口>
>
> blare：v. 发出响亮刺耳的声音
>
> with：引导独立主格结构

It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed `at the wheel` while two others `with black stocking` over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop `with iron bars`. 

> at the wheel: one man was the driver
>
> with black stockings：介词短语作后置定语

> with iron bars：方式状语

While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his `staff` began throwing furniture out of the window. 

> staff：集合名词

> * 单数：强调整体 - The staff was very good. 全体员工都很棒。
> * 复数：强调个体 - The staff were very good. 每一个员工都很棒。

Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The `raid` was all over in three minutes, for the men `scrambled` back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. 

> raid：n. 突袭；偷袭
>
> scramble：爬行
>
> * scramble for：争夺

Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing `ashtrays` and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.
