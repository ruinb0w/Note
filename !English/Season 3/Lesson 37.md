# Lesson 37 

## The Westhaven Express

We have learnt to expect that trains will be `punctual`. After years of `conditioning`, most of us `have developed an unshakable faith in` railway timetables. Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time. 

> punctual: on time
>
> conditioning: the process of being influenced
>
> * be conditioned by =  be influenced by
> * be conditioned to (doing) sth. = be used to (doing) sth.
> * conditioned reflex: 条件反射

> sb. have faith in sth./sb. : 信任

Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily `dislocate` railway services. `It is all too easy to` blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.

> dislocate = disturb / disrupt

> It is all too easy to

　　After `consulting` my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted mere hour and seventeen minutes. When I boarded the train, I `could not help noticing` that a great many local people got on as well. 

> consult: ask sb. for advice
>
> could not help noticing: 

At the time, this did not strike me as odd. I reflected that there must be a great many local people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. Neither was I surprise when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder, It suddenly `dawned on` me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely `chugging` along at thirty. One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. 

> dawned on: 明白了
>
> chug:  slowly, noisily, and with difficulty

I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. I determined to `lodge a complaint` as soon as we arrived. Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. 

> lodge a complaint: make a complaint officially

There was `a note of triumph` in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. It said: 'This service has been suspended.'

> triumph: 胜利, 获胜
