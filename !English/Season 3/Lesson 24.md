# Lesson 24 

## A skeleton in the cupboard

​	We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years. The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation. The terrible secret is called 'a `skeleton` in the cupboard'. At some dramatic moment in the story, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined. The `reader's hair stands on end` when he reads in the final pages of the novel that the heroine a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.

　　It is all very well for such things to occur in fiction. `To varying degrees`, we all have secrets which we do not want even our closest friends to learn, but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard. The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and `he is very pound of the fact.` George studied medicine in his youth.

Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories. I once spend an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house. George `showed` me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used. He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner. 

> show：v. 引领 

After I had `stacked` my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers, I decided to hang one of the tow suits I had brought with me in the cupboard. I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of two suits I had brought with me in the cupboard. I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it suits I had brought with me in the cupboard. I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it `petrified`.

A skeleton was dangling before my eyes. The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly and it `gave me the impression that` it `was about to leap` out at me. Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George. This was worse than "a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton! But George was `unsympathetic`. 'Oh, that,' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend. 'That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time.'
