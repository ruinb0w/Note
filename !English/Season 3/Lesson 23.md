# Lesson 23 

## One man's meat is

​	People become quite `illogical` when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten. If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great `delicacy`. You would not be able to understand why some people find it `repulsive`. 

> delicate adj. - delicacy n.
>
> repulsive adj.

On the other hand, your `stomach would turn` at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat -- the normally accepted `practice` in many northern countries. The sad truth is that most of us have been `brought up to eat certain foods` and we `stick to them all our lives`.

> turn one's stomach / make one's stomach turn：反胃
>
> practice：put into practice 付诸实践
>
> bring up to = raise to
>
> stick to = keep to

　　No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail. Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world. There are countless people who, ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food. My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are despised. As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own. For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him. The idea never `appealed to` me very much, but one day, after heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails `taking a stroll` on some of my `prize` plants. 

> appeal to = attract 吸引
>
> take a stroll：take a walk slowly and relaxingly
>
> prize：valuable

Acting `on a sudden impulse`, I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert. Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift. I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for `a couple of` hours. I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner. 

> on (a sudden) impulse = desire 一时冲动
>
> a couple of：一两个，几个

Snails would, of course, be the main dish. I did not `fancy` the idea and I `reluctantly` followed Robert out of the room. To our dismay, we saw that there were snails everywhere: they had escaped from the paper bag and had `taken complete possession of` the hall! I have never been able to look at a snail since then.

> fancy = like
>
> reluctantly：unwillingly 
>
> take possession of ...：占领；占有
>
> sb. in possession of sth.
>
> sth. in the possesion of sb.
