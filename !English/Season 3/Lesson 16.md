# Lesson 16 

## Mary had a little lamb

​	Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece. One of Mary's `prize` possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her. 

> prize = precious / valued

She `kept it tied` to a tree in a field during the day and went to `fetch` it every evening. One evening, however, the lamb was missing. The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.

> keep ... done : 使……处于某种状态 
>
> * keep … done（被动）/ keep doing …（主动）
>
> fetch = get v. 去取（某物）; 去接（某人）

　　When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened. Dimitri at once `set out to` find the thief. He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village. 

> set out to do : 着手做

After telling several of his friends about the `theft`, Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly `acquired` a new lamb. Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily `accused him of` stealing the lamb. 

> theft : n. 偷盗行为，偷盗案 = the crime of stealing
>
> acquire: you buy or obtain it for yourself, or someone gives it to you.
>
> accuse sb. of (doing): 指责，指控某人

He told him he `had better return it` or he would call the police. Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard. `It was true that he had just bought a lamb, he explained, but his lamb was black.` Ashamed of having acted so `rashly`, Dimitri `apologized to Aleko for having accused him.` 

> had better do sth. : 最好做某事
>
> It is true that ..., but ... : 诚然......，但是......
>
> rashly: do things too quickly, without thinking carefully about whether they are sensible or not.
>
> apologize to sb. for sth. 因为某事向某人道歉

While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped. When he went outside half an hour later, he was astonished to find the little black lamb was almost white. Its wool, which had been `dyed` black, had been washed clean by the rain!

> dye : v. 染; n. 染料
