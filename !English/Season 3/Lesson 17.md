# Lesson 17 

## The longest suspension

​	Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known, `sailed into` New York `Harbour` in 1524 and named it Angouleme. He described it as 'a very `agreeable` situation located within two small hills `in the midst of` which flowed a great river.'

> Harbour (BrE) = Harbor (AmE)

Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain `immortal`, for on November 21st, 1964, the longest `suspension` bridge in the world was `named after` him.

　　The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, `joins Brooklyn to Staten Island`. It has a span of 4,260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to `be taken into account` by its designer. Two great towers support four huge cables. 

> join … to ≈ connect … to … 
>
> be taken into account  =  be taken into consideration

The towers are built on `immense` underwater platforms make of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These `alone` took sixteen months to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. 

> immense ≈ huge / enormous
>
> alone :  adv. 只有（表强调）

They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. `It has been estimated that` if the bridge `were packed with` cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object `drawn` as faintly as possible'.
