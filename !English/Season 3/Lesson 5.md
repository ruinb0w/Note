## Lesson 5 

### The facts

`Editors` of newspapers and magazines often go to `extremes` to `provide their reader with` unimportant facts and `statistics`. 

> edit - edition - editor
>
> extremes adj. 非常的, 极端的; n. 非常, 极端
>
> statistic 统计数值 
>
> provide sb. with sth.

Last year a `journalist` had `been instructed` by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African `republic`. 

> journalist ≈ reporter
>
> be instructed
>
> republic 共和的

When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refuse to publish it. The article began: 'Hundreds of steps `lead to` the high wall which `surrounds` the president's palace'. 

> lead to：通向; 导致
>
> surround v. 环绕，围绕; adj. 环绕立体声的 - surrounding adj. 环绕的

The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him find out the `exact` number of steps and the height of the wall.

> exact ：具体的

　　The journalist immediately set out to `obtain` these important facts, but the took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon `go to press`. 

> obtain sth. <正式> = <口> get sth.
>
> go to press ≈ be printed

He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax `informing` the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. 

> inform <正式> = <口> tell

When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor `reluctantly` published the article as it had originally been written.

> reluctant ≈ unwilling

A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.
