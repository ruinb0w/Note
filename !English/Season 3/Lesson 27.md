# Lesson 27 

## Nothing to sell and nothing to buy

​	It has been said that everyone lives by selling something. `In the light of` this statement, teachers `live by selling knowledge`, `philosophers` by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be possible to measure the value of material good `in terms of` money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. 

>in the light of sth. (BrE) = in light of sth. (AmE) = according to … / taking … into account / considering …

>live by selling sth. = keep sb. alive by doing ... ≈ live on sth. 以……为食物

`There are times when` we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might `grudge paying` a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to sell.

> grudge doing = be unwilling to do sth.
>
> there are times when = sometimes

　　Tramps seem to be the only `exception to` this general rule. Beggars almost sell themselves as human being to `arouse` the pity of passers-by. But real tramps are not beggars. They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others. `In seeking independence`, they do not sacrifice their human dignity. 

> with the exception of (= except) 除此之外

> without exception (双重否定) 没有例外

> arouse: 引起，或者唤醒某人的某种情绪或态度。

> seek = look for 寻找

> in doing sth. 在做什么事的时候

A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and `is fully aware of` the consequences. He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but his is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people. His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease. 

> be (well / full / perfectly) aware of / hat …  = know about … 意识到……

By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do. He may hunt, beg, or stead occasionally to keep himself alive; he may even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of my even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of tramps `with contempt` and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little `envious of` their simple way of life and their freedom from care?

> with contempt = contemptuously
>
> envious of 嫉妒
