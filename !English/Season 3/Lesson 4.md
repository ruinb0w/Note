## Lesson 4 

### The double life of Alfred Bloggs

　　These days, people who do `manual` work often receive `far more` money than people who work in offices. 

> manual worker (laborer) = blue-collar worker
>
> mental / intellectual worker (laborer) = white-collar worker
>
> far : (作比较时用于强调) ……得多

People who work in offices are frequently `referred to as` "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. 

> refer to…as… : 称……为....
>
> refer to… : 提及

Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to `sacrifice` higher pay for the `privilege` of becoming white-collar workers. 

> sacrifice v. 牺牲，献出
>
> privilege : n. 荣幸

This can `give rise to` `curious` situations, as it did `in the case of` Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.

> give rise to = lead to / cause/ result in
>
> curious : unusual or difficult to understand
>
> in the case of : 在……的情况下
>
> in case of + 名词: 万一；如果发生；假设
>
> in case (that) + 从句: 万一；如果发生；假设

　　When he got married, Alf was too `embarrassed to say` anything to his wife about his job. 

> embarrassing (something) / embarrassed (someone)

He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a `smart` black suit. 

> smart : [英国英语] 整洁的

He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status `is well worth` the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.
