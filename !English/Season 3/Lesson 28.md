# Lesson 28 

## Five pound too dear

​	Small boats `loaded with` `wares` sped to the great liner as she was entering the harbour. Before she had `anchored`, the men from the boats had climbed on board and the decks were son covered with colourful `rugs` from Persia, silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware. It was difficult not to be `tempted`. Many of the tourists on board had begun `bargaining with` the tradesmen, but I decide not to buy anything until I had disembarked.

　　I had `no sooner got off the ship than` I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring. I had no `intention of` buying one, but I could not conceal the fact that I `was impressed by` the size of the diamonds. Some of them were as big as marbles. The man `went to great lengths to prove` that the diamonds were real. As we were walking past a shop, he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass. It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.

　　The next man `to approach` me was selling expensive pens and watches. I `examined` one of the pens closely. It certainly looked genuine. At the base of the gold cap, the words 'made in the U.S.A' had been nearly `inscribed`. The man said that the pen was worth $50, but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30. 

> to approach = getting close to
>
> examine ≈ inspect v. 仔细检查
>
> inscribe v. 刻写，雕

> * engraved

I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $5. `Gesticulating` wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous, but he eventually reduced the price to $10. Shrugging my shoulders, I began to walk away when, a moment later, he ran after me and `thrust` the pen into my hands. Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair, he `readily` accepted the $5 I have him. I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain -- until I got back to the ship. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single world!

> gesticulating v. （讲话时）打手势
>
> thrust v. 硬塞给
>
> readily adv. 乐意地，容易地 = willingly
