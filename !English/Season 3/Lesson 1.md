## Lesson 1 

### A Puma at large

​	Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. 

When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been `spotted` forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. 

> spot vt. 发现

However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo `felt obliged to ` investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

> oblige：(formal) 使……感到必须
>
> * feel obliged to do sth 不得不（做某事）, 必须（做某事）
> * be obliged to do sth. 感到不得不做某事

　　The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. 

It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is `cornered`. 

> corner vt. 使走投无路，使陷入困境

The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. 

Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. 

Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found `clinging to` bushes. 

> clinging to = stick to 

Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. 

The experts were now fully `convinced` that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? 

> convince sb -> sb. be convinced 使某人信服
>
> are convinced of sth.
>
> are convinced to do sth.
>
> convincing adj. 令人信服的

As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been `in the possession of` a private collector and somehow managed to escape. 

> in the possession of 被...拥有
>
> in possession of 拥有...

The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. 

It is `disturbing` to think that a dangerous wild animal is still `at large` in the quiet countryside.

> disturbing：adj.使人不安的; 使人苦恼的
>
> at large: 未被捕的，自由的
