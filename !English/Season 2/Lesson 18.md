# Lesson 18

## He often does this!

​	After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

　　'Did you have a good meal?' he asked

　　'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'

　　The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

　　'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!'
