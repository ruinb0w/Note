# Lesson 53

## Hot snake

​	**At last** firemen have put out a big forest fire in California. Since then, they have been trying to **find out** how the fire began. Forest fires **are often caused by** **broken glass** or by **cigarette ends** which people carelessly throw away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were also **quite** sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. 

> quite == very
>
> quiet == silent

This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed **the remains of** a snake which was **wound** round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line. 

> the remains of ...的遗体
>
> wind-wound：缠绕

In this way, he was able to solve the mystery. The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.
