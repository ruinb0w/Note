# Lesson 30

## football or polo?

​	The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home. I **like sitting** by the Wayle on fine afternoons.

> * would you like swimming? 你喜欢游泳吗?

It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children **were playing** games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river. 

> be过去分词 doing 表过去进行

Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat. Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

> so that : 引导目的状语从句

> * I close my eyes so that I could stop missing you.

I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight: they had all run away! The man laughed when he realized what had happened. He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.
