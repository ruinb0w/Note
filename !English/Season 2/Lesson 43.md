# Lesson 43

## Over the South Pole

​	In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American explorer, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time. **Though**, at first, Byrd and his men **were able to** take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay below, they soon **ran into serious trouble**. 

> though vs although
>
> * though 可以放句末
> * as though 好像
> * even though 即使
>
> be able to = succeed in doing sth. / manage to do sth.
>
> ran into = get into

At one point, it **seemed** certain that their plane would crash. It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 **feet**. 

> feet 英尺, (foot的复数形式)

Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains **by** 400 feet. 

> by 可以表示数量或程度达到

Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more mountains in sight. The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.
