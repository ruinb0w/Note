# Lesson 17

## Always young

​	My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be **at least** thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl. Jennifer will have to **take part in** a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, 'Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!'
