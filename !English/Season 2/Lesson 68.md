# Lesson 68

## Persistent

​		I crossed the street **to avoid meeting** him, but he saw me and came **running** towards me. 

> came running 表示朝我跑过来
>
> v. + v.ing 现在分词作伴随状语, 修饰前面的动词

It was no use **pretending** that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. **No matter how** busy you are, he always **insists on coming** with you. 

> no matter + 疑问词 = 疑问词 + ever(e.g. however busy you are)

I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

　　'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'

　　'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning -- until I saw you. **You're not busy doing anything, are you?**'

> 反意疑问句: 前肯后否, 前否后肯

　　'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to...'

　　'Would you mind **my** coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.

> my 做动名词的逻辑主语，说明动作发出者

　　'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'

　　'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!’
