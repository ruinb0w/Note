# Lesson 52

## A pretty carpet

​	We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning. I **have been trying** to **get my new room in order**. 

> get sth. in order
>
> have been doing 过去完成进行时, 从过去到现在一直持续

This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books. To make matters worse， the room is **rather** small， so I have temporarily put my books on the floor. 

> rather 相当, 很

At the moment， they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room. **A short while ago**， my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs. She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor. 'This is the prettiest carpet **I have ever seen**，' she said. She gazed at it for some time thenadded， 'You don't need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!'
