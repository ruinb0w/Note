# Lesson 40

## Food and talk

​	Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to **Mrs.** Rumbold. 

> Mr. 先生
>
> Mrs. 女士(已婚的)
>
> Ms. 女士(婚姻状态不明)
>
> Miss 女士(未婚)

Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even **look up** when I **took my seat** beside her. 

> look up 抬头, 查阅
>
> look up to sb.：仰慕尊敬某人
>
> look down to sb.：看不起某人
>
> look for：寻找（丢失的，想要的）
>
> take one's seat == seat down

Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I **tried to make conversation**.

> try to do 尽力做
>
> try doing 尝试做

　　'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'

　　'No,' she answered.

　　'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.

　　'No,' she answered.

　　'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.

　　'No,' she answered.

　　In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.

　　'Young man,' she answered, '**if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner**!"
