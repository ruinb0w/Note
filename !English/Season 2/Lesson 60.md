# Lesson 60

## The future

​	At a village fair, I decided to visit a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky. I went into her tent and she told me to sit down. After I **had given** her some money, she **looked** into a crystal ball and **said**: '**A relation of yours** is coming to see you. 

> a relation of yours 双重所有格
>
> * a picture of tom(tom的一张照片, 照片里是tom)
>
> * a picture of tom's(属于tom的一张照片, 照片里不一定是tom)

She **will be arriving** this evening and intends to stay for a few days. 

> will be doing 将来进行时(表示对将来的预测)

The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you know well will rush towards you. She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place. That is all.'

​	As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me. 'Where have you been hiding?' she asked impatiently. 'Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her. We are late already.' As she walked away, I followed her out of the fair.
