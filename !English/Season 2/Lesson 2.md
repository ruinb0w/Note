# Lesson 2

## Breakfast or lunch

​	It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. `I looked out of the window`. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'

> 这里的look 和 out是分开的, out 连着of window

​	'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.

　　'What are you doing?' she asked.

　　'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.

　　'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'
