# Lesson 15

## Good news

​	The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.

　　'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.

　　'Don't interrupt,' he said.

　　Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!
