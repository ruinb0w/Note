# Lesson 58

## A blessing in disguise?

​	The tiny village of Frinley **is said to** possess a 'cursed tree'. Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased. The tree was planted near thechurch fifty years ago, but **it is** only in recent years **that** it has gained an evil reputation. 

> 强调句型: it is(was) + 被强调部分 + that(who, whom) + 其他成分

It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been asked to **have the tree cut down**, but **so far** he has refused.

He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said, the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!
