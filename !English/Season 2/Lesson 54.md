# Lesson 54

## Sticky finger

​	After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops. It was still early when I returned home. The children were at school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. So I decided to make some meat pies. In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry. **At exactly that moment**, the telephone rang. Nothing could have been more annoying. I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Helen Bates. It took me ten minutes to persuade her to ring back later. At last I hung up the receiver. What a mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on the telephone, and on the doorknobs. I had **no sooner got back to the kitchen than the doorbell rang** loud enough to wake the dead. 

> no sooner ... than: hardly...when...

This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter!
