## Did you want to tell me something

​	Dentists always ask questions **when** it is impossible for you to answer. 

> it 指代 answer

My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told me to rest for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool. He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing. He then asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my new job in London. In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue **was busy searching** out the hole where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say anything. When the dentist at last **removed the cotton wool from my mouth**, I **was able to** tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.
