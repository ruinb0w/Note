## Everything except the weather

​	My old friend, Harrison, **had lived** in the Mediterranean for many years **before** he **returned** to England. 

He **had often dreamed of** retiring in England and **had planned to** settle down in the country. He **had no sooner returned than** he **bought** a house and went to live there. 

> no sooner ... than ... : 一...就...

Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, **for** **even though** it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. 

> for 表原因
>
> even though: 尽管, 虽然

After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted **as if** he had never lived in England before. 

> as if == as though: 好像

In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had **hardly** had time to settle down **when** he sold the house and left the country. 

> hardly ... when... 放句首要倒装
>
> Hardly had he had time to settle down when ...

The dream he had had for so many years ended there. Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.
