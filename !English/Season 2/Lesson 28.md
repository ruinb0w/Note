# Lesson 28

## No parking

​	Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths. he has just bought a new house in the city, but **ever since** he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners. 

> ever since = since

When he returns home **at night**, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate. 

> **in the** morning, **in the** afternoon, **at** night

**Because of** this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once. 

> because：连词，后跟句子(a subject and a verb)
>
> because of：介词短语，后跟名词性质的成分 / 动名词

Jasper has put up 'No Parking' signs outside his gate, but these have not had any effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen. I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has been turned to stone yet!
