## success story

​	Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his **experiences** as a young man. 

> experiences 经历可数, experience经验不可数

Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company, but as a boy **he used to work** in a small shop. 

> used to do sth. 过去常常做某事, 现在不做了
>
> (get | be) used to [doing] sth.：习惯于（某事物）

It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day. He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own. In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes. At that time he had two helpers. In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people. Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success. He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!
