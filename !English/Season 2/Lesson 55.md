## Not a gold mine

​	Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine called 'The Revealer' has been invented and it has **been used to** detect gold which has been buried in the ground.

The machine **was used in** a cave near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates **used to** hide gold. 

> be used in == be used to

The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party **was examining** the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feel deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost **worthless**. 

> worthless 没有价值的

The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk. **In spite of** this, many people **are confident that** 'The Revealer' may reveal something of value fairly soon.
