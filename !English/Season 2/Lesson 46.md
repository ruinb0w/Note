No one could **account for** the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy. 

> account for：说明理由，做出（满意）解释

It suddenly **occurred to** one of the workers to open up the box. He **was astonished at** what he found. A man was lying in the box on top of a pile of woolen goods. He **was so surprised at being discovered** that he did not even try to run away. 

> be surprised at doing sth.

After he was arrested, the man admitted hiding in the box before the plane left London. He had had a long and uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the wooden box for over eighteen hours. The man was ordered to pay \$3,500 for the cost of the trip. The normal price of a ticket is ​\$2,000!
