# Lesson 65

## Jumbo versus the police

​	Last Christmas， the circus owner， Jimmy Gates， decided to take some presents to a children's hospital. Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls， he **set off** down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo. 

> set off 出发

He **should have known** that the police would never allow this sort of thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he **ought to have gone** along a side street **as** Jumbo was **holding up the traffic**. 

> ought to have done == should have done
>
> hold traffic 阻碍交通

Though Jimmy agreed to go at once， Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street. The police **had a difficult time**， but they were most amused. 'Jumbo must weigh a few tons，' said a policeman afterwards， 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him. Of course， we should arrest him， but as he has a good record， we shall let him off this time.'
