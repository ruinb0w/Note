# Lesson 39

## Am I all right?

​	While John Gilbert was in hospital, he asked his doctor to tell him whether his operation had been successful, but the doctor **refused to do so**. The following day, the patient asked for a bedside telephone. When he was alone, he telephoned the hospital exchange and asked for Doctor Millington. When the doctor answered the phone, Mr. Gilbert said he was inquiring about **a certain patient**, a Mr. John Gilbert. He asked if Mr. Gilbert's operation had been successful and the doctor told him that it had been. He then asked when Mr. Gilbert **would be allowed to go home** and the doctor told him that he would have to stay in hosptial for another two weeks. 

Then Dr. Millington asked the caller if he was a relative of the patient. 'No,' the patient answered, 'I am Mr. John Gilbert.'
