​	People are not **so** honest **as** they once were.

The temptation to steal is greater than ever before -- especially in large shops. A detective recently watched a **well-dressed** woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings. 

> well-dressed 复合形容词, 将两个形容词合在一起

One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for the detective to watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she **chose** one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible. 

> choose - chose - chosen

Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter. The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!
