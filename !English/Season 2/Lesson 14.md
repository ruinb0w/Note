# Lesson 14

## Do you speak English

​	I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I **drove on to** the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he **asked me for a lift**. **As soon as** he had got into the car, I said good morning to him **in French** and he replied in the same language. **Apart from** a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
