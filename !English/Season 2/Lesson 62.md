## after the fire

​	Firemen **had been fighting** the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could **get it under control**.

A short time before, great trees had covered the countryside **for miles around**. Now, smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills. Winter **was coming on** and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, **for** heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well. 

> 进行时表示即将要发生的动作、事情

When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly. The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes. The planes **had been planting** seed for nearly a month when it began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root. In place of the great trees which **had been growing** there for centuries patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.
