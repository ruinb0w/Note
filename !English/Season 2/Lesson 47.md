# Lesson 47

## A thirsty ghost

​	A public house which was recently bought by Mr.Ian Thompson **is up for** sale. 

> be up for：用于...
>
> for sale：出售
>
> on sale：廉价出售

Mr.Thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted. He told me that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise **coming** from the bar. 

> coming 现在分词作宾语补足语

The next morning, he found that the doors had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning. He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which the ghost **must have drunk** the night before. When I suggested that some villagers **must have come** in for a free drink, Mr.Thompson shook his head. 

> come - came - come

The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.
