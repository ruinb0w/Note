# Lesson 29

## Taxi

​	Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service. The 'taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers. The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field. Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has **flown** passengers to many unusual places. 

> fly - flew - flown

Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. Captain Fawcett **has just refused** a strange request from a businessman. 

> She **refused** to work for the enemy. 拒绝
>
> She **denied** working for the enemy. 否认
>

The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not **take** him because the trip was too dangerous.

> fetch：去拿，找来，请来(去,回)
>
> bring：带来(来)

> take：带走，拿走(去)
