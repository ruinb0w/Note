# Lesson 49

## The end of a dream

​	**Tired of sleeping** on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up **for years** to buy a real bed. 

> be tired of doing sth. 厌倦做某事

For the first time in his life, he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress. Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house. He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below. The young man did **not** wake up **until** the bed had struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the mattress. **Glancing** at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.
