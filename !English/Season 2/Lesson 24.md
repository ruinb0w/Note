I had just lost $50 **and** I felt very upset.

'I left the money in my room,' I said, 'and it's not there now.' The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing. '**Everyone's** losing money these days,' he said. 

> everyone 不定代词表单数

> everything, everybody 也一样

He started to complain about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock at the door. A girl came in and put an envelope on his desk. It contained $50. 'I found this outside this gentleman's room,' she said. 'Well,' I said to the manager, 'there is still some honesty in this world!'
