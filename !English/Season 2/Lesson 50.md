# Lesson 50

## Taken for a ride

​	I love travelling in the country, but I don't like **losing** my way.

> lose 丢失
>
> loose 松了

　　I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.

　　'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'

　　'I'll tell you where to get off.' answered the conductor.

　　I sat **in the front of** the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I **realized with a shock** that I was the only passenger left on the bus.

　　'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we go.'

　　'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.

　　'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'

　　'It doesn't matter,' I said. 'I'll get off here.'

　　'We're going back now,' said the conductor.

　　'Well, in that case, I **prefer to stay** on the bus,' I answered.

> prefer to do A rather than do B
