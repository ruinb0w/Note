The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter. I **not only** spoke English very carefully, **but** very clearly **as well**. 

> not only ... but ... as well = not only ... but also ... (不仅A而且B)
>
> neither … nor：既不 … 也不 … （A和B都不）
>
> either … or：或者 … 或者 … (不是A就是B)

The porter, however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. he answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly. 'I am a foreigner,' I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that! The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. 'You'll soon **learn** English!' he said.

> * Time spent studying does not equal learning.

I wonder. In England, **each** **person** speaks a different language.

> every 强调整体

> person 具体

> people 泛指

The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?
