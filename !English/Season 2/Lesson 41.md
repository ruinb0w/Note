# Lesson 41

## Do you call that a hat

​	'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.

　　'You **needn't be** so rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.

　　I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We **had been** in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife **was** still in front of the mirror.

　　'We mustn't buy things we don't need,' I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.

　　'You **needn't have said** that,' my wife answered. 'I **needn't remind** you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.'

　　'I **find it beautiful**,' I said. 'A man **can never** have too many ties.'

> find (sth.|sb.) + 形容词
>
> can never / cannot … too …：无论怎么 … 也不过分

　　'And a woman can't have too many hats,' she answered.

　　Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!
