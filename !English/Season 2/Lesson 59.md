# Lesson 59

## In or out?

​	Our dog, Rex, **used to sit** outside our front gate and dark. Every time he **wanted to** come into the garden he **would** bark **until** someone opened the gate. As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate. However, when I **was going** out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. 

> be going 表示将要

This time he was barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. **As soon as** he **opens** the gate from the outside, he **comes** into the garden and **waits** until the gate **shuts**. Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.
